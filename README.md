## Design Process

I created this website for people who wish to find my music projects in one convenient place. For this website, I wanted to organize my covers in a user-friendly format, facilitating easy exploration and discovery. I also prioritized user experience by creating an intuitive interface for easy navigation through the collection of covers.

User Stories:
- As a music lover, I aim to discover and collect heartfelt covers of familiar songs. I desire a platform that offers a diverse range of quality renditions, making it easy for me to explore and enjoy unique musical interpretations.
- As someone seeking emotional connections through music, I seek a website that showcases covers capable of evoking deep feelings and transporting me into an immersive sonic experience.
- As a musician seeking to connect through music, I want a website where I not only share my covers but also establish connections with others.
- As a musician, I aim to share my heartfelt renditions of beloved songs. I aspire to create a platform where I can showcase my passion for music.

## Features

My website has a good number of pages. To summarise the features found within the pages, here is a list of existing features. Below that are some features I wanted to implement but couldn't due to skill and time.
 
### Existing Features

- Navigation Bar - allow users to access the other pages of my website with a simple click of a button
- Biography/About Section - allows others to learn more about me, my influences, and the journey behind my music
- Video Players - allows others to view my music
- Buttons for social media links - allows users to reach me in other places
- Dropdown menu for behind-the-scenes & teasers - allows users to view additional content
- Fade-in animation & scroll to reveal main content - makes website look and feel more dynamic

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Section for users to post comments
- More micro-interactions & animations
- More music to showcase (as always)

## Technologies Used

This website uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

- [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
    - The project uses **Normalize.css** to makes browsers render all elements more consistently.

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
    - I used this when I needed help implementing something :P.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Navigation Bar:
   1. Verify that it displays correctly
   2. Verify that the buttons bring users to the correct page
   3. Try moving from page to page from different pages

2. Home/Music/BTS/Teasers Page:
   1. Go to the different pages to check if all pages area accessible
   2. Verify that content displays correctly
   3. Verify that page is responsive

3. Contact Info Page:
   1. Go to Contact info page
   2. Verify that content displays correctly
   3. Verify that buttons to external links work
   4. Verify that page is responsive

This website should function similarly with all browsers. Screen sizes changes the layout of the buttons but content should be displayed similarly.

No interesting bugs and errors occured (I WISH IT DID THOUGH). Just the normal 'things not displaying properly' or syntax errors, etc.
